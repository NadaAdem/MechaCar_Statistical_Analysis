# MechaCar Analysis - AutosRUs using R
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to identify which variables can predict the MPG of a car prototype, "MechaCar", for the fictional company AutosRUs. Summary statistics are generated and t-tests are performed for individual manufacturing lots. Finally, a study is designed to compare MechaCar to the competition. R and tidyverse are used to accomplish this analysis.
